# simple-maven-project-with-tests
A Maven project that just has some test failures (and skips) at random, to demonstrate result reporting.

## CI/CD testing
I've modified the original code to test CI/CD (and therefore wanted tests to pass) on varying platforms. This repository will work with Jenkins, Travis and Github actions.
